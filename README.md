Model to Calculate Employee Salary:

This model calculates the in-hand salary of an employee by starting with the base salary and then adding components such as Dearness Allowance (DA) and House Rent Allowance (HRA). It then deducts the applicable tax percentage and adds any other additional monetary benefits. The final result is the employee's in-hand pay.
